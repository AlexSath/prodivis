# ProDiVis
A tool built in python to help visualize protein distribution in three-dimensional cell culture models. Built for data acquired in 'z-stack' form, where different layers of a structure are imaged individually using a device such as a confocal microscope.

## Inherent Problems with Confocal Data
Confocal microscopy faces two major challenges:

1. Fluorescent signal will have noise from above and below the focal plane. Deconvolution software can account for some of this noise, but cannot remove it completely.
2. Emitted light must travel down the depth of the 3D structure being imaged to the focal plane, reducing intensity. The fluorescence generated by the fluorophore must then travel back up through the structure to the detector, further reducing intensity.

These two problems lead to a loss in percieved fluorescence near the bottom of 3D structures being imaged. The graph below shows an example of this, taken from 86 fluorescent slices of stained nuclei in a 3D Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) cell culture model. 
 
DAPI, which stains the DNA in these nuclei, should be the same - on average - per slice across the depth of the cultured GBM.

This suggests that confocal images of 3D structures may not actually represent biological reality. Fluorescent signal may be underestimated at the bottom of tumoroids. 

## The Solution
A methodology to account for fluorescence loss across the depth of confocal z-stacks. This can be performed using a normalization signal, such as DAPI, which should remain constant across the depth of a structure. Signal of interest (such as fluorescence associate with a protein of interest) can be adjusted using the normalization signal for a better representation of biological reality.
